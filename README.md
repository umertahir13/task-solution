Create a Java API for filtering a collection of products.
A product has the following fields; name, category and price.
The starter code includes failing tests that need to be made to pass without making any changes to the test class.
The tasks below should be completed by making changes to the ProductFilterServiceImplementation class methods.

1. Specific criteria:

   Return all products where name equals a given value.
